# Gamified Task Manager

The goal is to create a gamified task manager app (read: fancy to-do list with built-in motivators) that surpasses performance of other task manangement apps with its aesthetic design and element of incentive. 

The core of this app is a to-do list, and when users finish daily/weekly/monthly tasks, they can earn coins which they can then use to the purchase different outfits/furniture for their character and their living space. There will be two main screens: the to-do list and the character game space.
