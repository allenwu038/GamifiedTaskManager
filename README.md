# Gamified Task Manager

The goal is to create a gamified task manager app (read: fancy to-do list with built-in motivators) that surpasses performance of other task manangement apps with its aesthetic design and element of incentive. 

The core of this app is a to-do list, and when users finish daily/weekly/monthly tasks, they can earn coins which they can then use to the purchase different outfits/furniture for their character and their living space (with different aesthetics so we can cater to different tastes of users). There can also be different levels to grow towards that open up more stores and options for products to buy with game coins. There could even be a community aspect built in where users can add other users and and gift items. 

In terms of display, there will be two main screens: the to-do list and the character game space.
